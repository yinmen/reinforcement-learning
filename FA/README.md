## Function Approximation

### Learning Goals

- Understand the motivation for Function Approximation over Table Lookup
- Understand how to incorporate function approximation into existing algorithms
- Understand convergence properties of function approximators and algorithms
- Understand batching using experience replay


### Lectures & Readings

**Required:**
