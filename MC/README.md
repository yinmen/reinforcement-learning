## Model-Free Prediction & Control with Monte Carlo (MC)


### Learning Goals

- Understand the difference between Prediction and Control
- Know how to use the MC method for predicting state values and state-action values
- Understand the on-policy first-visit MC control algorithm
- Understand the off-policy every-visit MC control algorithm
- Understand the benefits of MC algorithms over the DP approach
