#### Overview

The goal for this repository is to become a comprehensive tutorial of Reinforcement Learning techniques. The focus is on practical applications and code examples. This does not mean that theory will be ignored completely, just that there will be fewer formal proofs than you may find a typical university course.

All code is written in Python 3 and the RL environments are taken from [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/). Advanced techniques use [Tensorflow](tensorflow.org/) for neural network implementations.
